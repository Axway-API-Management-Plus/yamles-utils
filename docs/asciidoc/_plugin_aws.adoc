This plugin retrieves lookup values and certificates from AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Certificate Manager.

It uses the AWS SDK to access the services.
Therefore the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-chain.html[default credentials chain] used by the SDK are also used by the providers of this plugin.

On systems directly running on EC2 instances, IAM roles can be used to authorize the service access, without specifying any credentials.
For systems running on AWS EKS, a K8s service account can be bound to an IAM role to enable the access to the services without using additional credentials.

Using environment variables (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`), system properties (`aws.accessKeyId`, `aws.secretAccessKey`), or configuration file, are also supported.


== Lookup Providers

This lookup providers of this plugin, retrieve the values form the AWS Secrets Manager.

The functions support structured secrets (e.g. key/values) or plain secrets (text/binary).

=== JSON Document Secrets

For secrets containing a JSON document, e.g. key/value pair, this lookup provider supports to read specific keys from the secret.

[cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Name*
|`aws_sm_json`

|*Built-In*
|no

|*Synopsis*
|Retrieves values from JSON secrets on AWS Secrets Manager.

2+|*Configuration Parameters*
|`secret_name`
|Name of the secret.
|`region`
|Optional region where the secret is located.
If not specified, the default region is used.

2+|*Lookup Function Arguments*
|`key`
|Secret key as JSON Pointer (e.g., `/user`).
|===

*Example*

In this example the secret `sandbox/anm` is stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The secret is stored using key/value pairs.

image:aws-sm-secrets.png[AWS Secrets]

The secret has two secret keys (`user` and `password`).

image:aws-sm-secrets-values.png[AWS Secrets]

In plaintext the secret is represented as a JSON document, storing the values with the secret key as property name.

.Lookup Function Configuration `lookup-func.yaml`
[source, yaml]
----
lookups:
  anm:
    provider: aws_sm_json
    config:
      secret_name: sandbox/anm
----

.Configuration Fragment `config.yaml`
[source, yaml]
----
anm:
  user: "{{ _anm('/user') }}"
  pwd: "{{ _anm('/password') }}"
----

NOTE: The secret is not limited to key/value pair. Any kind of JSON document is supported by this lookup provider.

=== Plaintext/Binary Secrets

[cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Name*
|`aws_sm_plain`

|*Built-In*
|no

|*Synopsis*
|Retrieves value from plain text or binary secret on AWS Secrets Manager.
The values of binary secrets are represented as Bas64 encoded strings.

2+|*Configuration Parameters*
|`prefix`
|Prefix to be be added before every secret name (see `key`).
|`region`
|Optional region where the secret is located.
If not specified, the default region is used.

2+|*Lookup Function Arguments*
|`key`
|Secret name.

The resulting secret name is build by the concatenation of `prefix` and `key`.
|===

*Example*

In this example the secret `sandbox/certs/root-ca` is stored in AWS Secrets Manager. The secret is supposed to contain a public root CA certificate in PEM format.

image:aws-sm-secrets-root-ca.png[AWS Secrets]

The PEM certificate is stored as plaintext.

image:aws-sm-secrets-values-root-ca.png[AWS Secrets]

A lookup function is defined to lookup certificates from secrets prefixed with `sandbox/certs`.

.Lookup Function Configuration `lookup-func.yaml`
[source, yaml]
----
lookups:
  certs:
    provider: aws_sm_plain
    config:
      region: "us-west-1"
      prefix: "sandbox/certs"
----

The lookup function can be used in simple certificate providers.

.Usage in certificate configuration
[source, yaml]
----
certificates:
  root-ca:
    provider: simple
    config:
      cert: "{{ _certs('/root-ca') }}"
----


== Certificate Providers

=== AWS Certificate Manager

[cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Name*
|`aws_cm`

|*Synopsis*
|Provides certificates from the AWS Certificate Manager.

2+|*Configuration Parameters*
|`arn`
|ARN of the certificate stored in the AWS Certificate Manager.
|`chain`
|Set to `true` to add the full certificate chain to policy project.
|===

*Example*

In this example, the public certificate of CA, issued the Cassandra cluster certificate, is stored in the policy project under the alias `cassandra-ca`.
For deployment, the certificate must be replaced by the public certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager.
The full certificate chain, has to be imported also. 

.Certificate Configuration
[source, yaml]
----
certificates:
  cassandra-ca:
    provider: aws_cm
    config:
      arn: "arn:aws:acm:us-west-1:000000000000:certificate/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      chain: true
