To use the Keepass DB, an according lookup function has to be defined.

.Lookup Function Defintion `lookup-func.yaml`
[source, yaml]
----
lookups:
  kdb:
    provider: keepass
    config:
      kdb: keepass.kdbx #<1>
      passphrase: "{{ _env('PASSPHRASE') }}" #<2>
----
<1> Keepass DB file is located relative to the `lookup-func.yaml` file.
<2> The `passphrase` parameter supports built-in lookup functions.

Use the lookup function `_kdb` to retrieve the values from the entry.

.Configuration Fragment

  user: "{{ _kdb('/General/generic-user-general', 'user') }}" #<1>
  pwd: "{{ _kdb('/General/generic-user-general', 'password') }}"

  user: "{{ _kdb('/General/generic-user-general', 'user') }}"
  field: "{{ _kdb('/General/generic-user-general', 'prop', 'field') }}"

== Certificate Providers

Currently this plugin doesn't provide any certificate providers.

Certificates stored in a KeePass database can be retrieved by one of the certificate provides of the <<Core>> plugin and the lookup functions provided by this KeePass plugin.
