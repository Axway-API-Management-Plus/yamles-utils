For the YAML entity store, environmentalized fields are configured in the `values.yaml` file of the project directory.
To configure the project for other stages, the whole `values.yaml` file has to be replaced by a file containing the new values.
Also, only static values are allowed.

If you want to split the configuration into multiple files, e.g. due to separate responsibility, or, if you want to retrieve values dynamically from other sources, the `values.yaml` file has to be dynamically generated.

The YAML-ES utilities enables to merge a `values.yaml` file from multiple fragments.
The order of the fragments is considered. If a field is provided by multiple fragments, the value of the latest fragment is used.

After all fragments are merged, the values of each field is evaluated as a _Mustache_ template.
If the value contains expressions delimited by double curly brackets (e.g., `{{ expression }}`), the block will be replaced by the result of the expression.
For example, expressions can be used to encode values as Base64 (required for encrypted fields), or to lookup values from external sources, etc.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Each value of the YAML properties is handled as a separate template. So it's not possible to use templates outside or across properties.

[NOTE]
====
In the above example, the `_env` lookup function is used to retrieve the value from an environment variable.
This function is provided as a built-in function by _YAML-ES Utilities_.
Custom lookup functions can be defined to retrieve values from other lookup providers (e.g. KeePass DB or AWS Secret Manager).

See <<Templates>> for more details about the evaluation of Mustache templates and the usage of lookup functions.
====

To merge configuration fragments, use the `merge config` command of _YAML-ES Utilities_.

----
yamlesutils merge [-m MODE] config
    [-f=FILE]... [-d=DIR]...
    [--lookup-functions=FILE]...
    (-o=FILE | [--project=DIR | --ignore-missing-values])

.Options for Merge Configuration
[cols="3,6a", options="header"]
|===
|Option
|Description

|`-m MODE` +
`--mode=MODE`
|Execution mode

* `CONFIG`: Build and write configuration (default).
* `DRY_RUN`: Build configuration, but don't write to disk.
* `SYNTAX_CHECK`: Check syntax of configuration files only.
Lookups are evaluated to empty strings; no connections to external systems (e.g. AWS Secrets Manager) are established.

|`-f FILE` +
`--fragment=FILE` +
`-c FILE` +
`--config=FILE`
|Configuration fragment to be merged to the `values.yaml` file.
The fragments are files, containing a single YAML document.

The parameter can be specified multiple times to merge multiple fragments.

The fragments are processed in the order as specified on the command line.
If a configuration parameter is configured by in multiple files, the last one wins.

|`-d DIR` +
`--dir=DIR`
|Directory to scan for YAML configuration fragments.
Each file within the directory having the extension `.yml` or `.yaml` are treated as configuration fragments.
The files are added to merged in alphabetical ascending order.

|`-o FILE` +
`--output=FILE`
|Target file to write the merged YAML configuration.
If `-` is specified, the merged configuration is written to `stdout`.

|`--project=DIR`
|Path to the directory containing the YAML-ES project.
If the project path is specified the `values.yaml` file within this directory will be overwritten.

|`--ignore-missing-values`
|If a project directory is specified, the current `values.yaml` file of this directory is loaded and all required fields are detected.

Before writing the merged configuration, the merge command checks if all required fields are also provided by the merged configuration.
On missing fields, the merge command stop with an error message.

With this option, missing fields are ignored and the merge command continue processing.
Missing or unused fields are just reported.

|`-l FILE` +
`--lookup-functions=FILE`
|YAML file to configure lookup functions.

Multiple parameters can be specified to use multiple lookup configurations.

== Basic Examples

The following files, used for this example are also located in the `examples/basic/config` folder.

There are two configuration fragments:

.fragments/global.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../examples/basic/config/fragments/global.yaml[]
----

.fragments/local.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../examples/basic/config/fragments/local.yaml[]
----

To merge the fragments use the following command:

.Simple merge of multiple fragments
[source, shell]
----
yamlesutils.sh merge config \ #<1>
  --fragment=fragments/global.yaml \ #<2>
  --fragment=fragment/local.yaml \ #<3>
  -o - #<4>
----
<1> Command to merge configuration fragments
<2> The `global.yaml` fragment
<3> The `local.yaml` fragment, which overwrites values from the `global.yaml`.
<4> Print the result to `stdout`

This will generate the following YAML document:

.Result
[source, yaml]
----
global:
  greeting:
    message: "Bonjour le monde" #<1> 
    enabled: true #<2>
local: #<3>
  country: "fr"
  application:
    name: "Application Extraordinaire"
----
<1> Overwritten by `local.yaml`.
<2> Provided by `global.yaml`.
<3> Completely provided by `local.yaml`.

Now we want to add an additional fragment:

.fragments/users.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../examples/basic/config/fragments/users.yaml[]
----
<1> Fields use Mustache templates to lookup values using the function `_users()`.
The parameter specifies the JSON Path to the property within the external JSON file (see below).
<2> The lookup value will be additionally encoded as Base64.

The fields contain Mustache templates, using a custom lookup function `_users()` to retrieve values from an external source.
To use the custom function, a provider for this function must be defined.
In this case we want to retrieve the values from a JSON file `users.json`.

.lookups/users.json
[source, json]
----
include::../../examples/basic/config/lookups/users.json[]
----

The provider is defined in a separate file `lookup-func.yaml`.


.lookup-func.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../examples/basic/config/lookup-func.yaml[]
----
<1> Defines the alias `users` for the lookup function configuration.
The corresponding lookup function is prefixed by an underscore `_users()`.
<2> Use the JSON lookup provider to retrieve values from a JSON file.
<3> Path to the JSON file.
If the path is not absolute, the path is relative to the directory containing the lookup function configuration file (directory of `lookup-func.yaml`).

To merge these fragments, an additional parameter `--lookup-functions` must be specified to configure the required lookup function.

[source, shell]
----
yamlesutils.sh merge config \ #<1>
  --lookup-functions=lookup-func.yaml \ #<2>
  -f fragments/global.yaml -f fragments/local.yaml -f fragments/users.yaml \ #<3>
  -o - #<4>
----
<1> Command to merge configuration fragments.
<2> Path to the lookup function configuration file.
<3> The configuration fragments to be merged.
<4> Print the result to `stdout`

.Result
[source, yaml]
----
global:
  greeting:
    message: "Bonjour le monde"
    enabled: true
local:
  country: "fr"
  application:
    name: "Application Extraordinaire"
  accounts: #<1>
    admin:
      upn: "admin" #<2>
      name: "Administrator" #<2>
      pwd: "Y2hhbmdlbWU=" #<3>
----
<1> The YAML document is similar to the previous result. Except the addition `accounts` object, provided by the `users.yaml` fragment.
<2> The templates specified in the fragment are resolved and the values are looked up from the external JSON file.
<3> The value is additionally Base64 encoded.
