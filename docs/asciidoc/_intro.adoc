== About YAMLES Utilities
The YAMLES Utilities provides the features to verify a YAML based policy project according to defined rules (linting), and to configure the policy project for target environments.

The utilities of this project can be used to build a CI/CD pipeline for automatic configuration and deployment of YAML Entity Store based projects (see <<YAML_Entity_Store>> for details).

== Use Cases

The uses cases, described in this section, are just examples to illustrate the opportunities of the YAMLES Utils.
They only give some ideas to build your own deployment pipeline.

=== Classic Topology Deployment

.Classic topology with separated concerns

The picture above visualize an example CI/CD pipeline.
The _YAML-ES Utilities_ tool provided by this project is used for linting and for the configuration of the stage specific project.
To verify the configured project and to deploy the configured project to a gateway, the standard tools of the AMPLIFY API Gateway 7.7 distribution are used.

Configurations with shared responsibility or staged dependent values are environmentalized.
A linter checks the project against coding rules (defined by the Ops team) to ensure that all required fields are environmentalized and all required entities exists.

With stage specific configurations (including certificates), a stage specific project is created.

Configuration parameter are sourced from multiple locations.
Configurations are retrieved from plain text files stored in the Git repository or from encrypted data sources.
Each team has its own set of configuration parameter (depending on their responsibility). Hierarchies of configurations ensures that values configured the Ops team supersede values defined by the Dev team.

The generated, stage specific project is verified for not configured fields or broken references.

After successful verification the project will be deployed to the target environment.
During to protect the configurations on the server, a passphrase is added during the deployment.

=== Container Deployment (Policy Image)

== YAML Entity Store
In newer versions of the API Gateway, policies can be stored as a YAML Entity Store (YAML-ES) instead of the classic XML based entity store (XML-ES).
With the YAML-ES, the entities are stored in YAML files in a directory structure similar to the structure of the Policy Studio project.

.YAML Enity Store Directory (simplified)
```

├── APIs
...
├── Environment\ Configuration
├── External\ Connections
...
├── Policies
├── Resources
├── Server\ Settings
│   ├── ...
│   ├── Cassandra\ Settings.yaml
...
├── System
└── values.yaml
```

Within the folders, entities are stored in files within the following schema (see also link:https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_yamles/apim_yamles_references/yamles_yaml_schema/index.html[YAML Schema]):

.Entity Schema
[source, yaml]
----
type: string #<1>
field: #<2>
  fieldName: value1
  fieldNameArray:
    - item
    - item
children: #<3>
  - type: string #<4>
    ...
----
<1> Type name of the entity
<2> Fields of entity as name/value pair(s)
<3> Optional list of children entities.
<4> Type of the children entity

Below is an example of the Cassandra settings entity in the YAML format.

./Server Settings/Cassandra Settings.yaml
[source, yaml]
----
type: CassandraSettings #<1>
fields: #<2>
  name: Cassandra Settings
  replication: '{{Server_Settings.Cassandra_Settings.replication}}' #<3>
  replicationStrategy: '{{Server_Settings.Cassandra_Settings.replicationStrategy}}'
  username: '{{Server_Settings.Cassandra_Settings.username}}'
  password: '{{Server_Settings.Cassandra_Settings.password}}'
children: #<4>
  - type: CassandraServer
    fields:
      name: Node 1
      host: ${env.cassandra.node1}
----
<1> Type `CassandraSettings` indicates the configuration of the Cassandra database.
<2> Fields to configure the Cassandra database and keyspace.
<3> Environmentalized field.
<4> Children entities for each configured Cassandra node.

Within the Cassandra settings some fields are environmentalized.
The double brackets `{{ }}` indicate an environmentalized field, where the value within the brackets reference the corresponding value within the `values.yaml` file of the project.
The reference is a JSON Path expression, where the parent and child nodes are separated by a single dot.

.`values.yaml`
[source, yaml]

    throttlingWriteConsistencyLevel: ONE

    useSSL: "false"
...
----
<1> Cassandra password is referenced by `{{Server_Settings.Cassandra_Settings.password}}` within the Cassandra settings.
